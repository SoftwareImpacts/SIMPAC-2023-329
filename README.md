# SURFATM-GIT-V4.2

SurfAtm (Personne et al., 2009 - Stella et al. 2011) is a model combining the surface energy balance and exchanges of ammonia, ozone and pesticid between an agro or ecosystem and the atmosphere at the field scale


**Model information**

the model is coded in C language.
File paths are relative. 
It is necessary to set up a "Source_code", a "data" and an "output" folder at the same level in the master directory :

../Code_source

../data

../output


The data folder contains all simulation parameters and variables.



 **Technical support :**

support.surfatm@agroparistech.fr


**Download**


The github download includes a folder for installation with Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 ("SURFATM-GIT-V4.2" directory).

This download is not necessary. 
It facilitates installation for this environment (Visual M. 2022).
